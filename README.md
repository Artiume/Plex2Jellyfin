Scripts to assist migrating from a Plex Media Server to a Jellyfin Media Server

- Migrate users: Creates a new user account on Jellyfin for each Plex user with access to your Plex Media Server
- Migrate ratings: Copies user ratings of media items from Plex over to Jellyfin (currently not working)
- Migrate playlists: Scan Plex playlists to create and populate identical playlists on Jellyfin (currently not working)

NOTE: The Jellyfin Media Server project is a community-run, open-source project, and as such, the API is in severe need of reworking. Because of issues with the Jellyfin API server-side, some of these scripts are currently not working. I will push out updates once the necessary fixes are made.
